# Unity2DGameKit
1.	Link to tutorial: https://create.unity3d.com/2d-game-kit
2.	I picked this tutorial because it was offered by Unity crew as suitable for the beginners.
3.	Trying to understand the scripts was the hardest part, they are pretty difficult for beginners. 
4.	From this tutorial I learned the hierarchy organization. And from doing this project I learned that itâ€™s better to back up all files in two different places because unity crash can destroy the whole project.
5.	I added a rocket to the end of the game and animation of it flying away. But I could not apply it to the project, still figuring it out.
